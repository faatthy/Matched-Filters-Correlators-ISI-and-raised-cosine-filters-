## Matched filters and correlators in noise-free 
environment 
To simulate a binary PAM signaling system, we start by generating 10 random binary bits. These bits 
are then converted into PAM symbols, where logic 1 becomes +1 and logic 0 becomes -1. The symbol 
duration is 1 second. 
To represent the pulse shaping function discreetly, we use 5 samples equally spaced, with a difference 
of 200 ms between each sample. This pulse shaping function is normalized to ensure that its energy is 
unity.
